### My story
  
Hi, my name is Zhi Qiu and you can call me Heather :blush:
  
- I'm a second-year graduate student of **Statistics** at Duke University who will graduate in `May 2021`.
- I finished my undergraduate degree of **Financial Mathematics** at University of Liverpool.

I studied and lived in China, UK and USA in the past few years. After these years' studying and internship experience in different countries about Data Analysis, Data Science and Quantitative Analytics in the FinTech industry, I found it most intriguing seeking a career path as a `Data Scientist / ML Engineer` in the US.

I'm passionate about building Machine Learning models for `financial companies or technical companies`. I've done three analytics internship in large commercial banks. I spent the most recent summer helping growing Wells Fargo's Small Business Classification model by about 20% in accuracy through dedicated efforts in text processing, machine leaning model fitting and original hierarchical structure construction.

I'm currently seeking a `full-time` **Data Scientist / Engineer** `position` preferably in the financial industry or the tech industry in the US, but I'm open to all opportunities anywhere. If you'd like to work together or know more about me, feel free to direct message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiqiu/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976). You can also approach me via `e-mail - zhi.qiu731@duke.edu`.

### My life
  
I currently live in Durham, NC and really enjoy the weather and forests here. I like travelling, walking, sitcoms and kpop. I enjoy seeing old friends and meeting new people. Always open to talk and different ideas :bulb:!
