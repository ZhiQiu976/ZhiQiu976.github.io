This post is about create a SQLite3 schema to store the [Spotify data set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md) in at least **3rd normal form** (3NF), populate the tables and then using an example SQL query to find the names of all playlists that contain instrumentals.

**The detailed source codes to is included in this [notebook](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts/blob/master/Spotify%20SQL/Spotify.ipynb).**

**You can also check the `Spotify SQL` folder in my `Github Repo` [ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts) to access the normalized Spotify database.**

# Database Normalization

Database normalization is performed for two main reasons - reduce redundancy and prevent inconsistencies on insert/update/delete.

Note: A fully normalized database is in domain-key normal form (DK/NF) if every constraint is a logical consequence of the definition of the candidate key and domains. However, most practical normalization procedures go through a series of steps known as first, second and third normal forms, and ignore potential modification anomalies that may remain.

`Outcome:`

- Every table should not have any
    - duplication
    - dependencies that are not key or domain constraints
    
<br />

## First Normal Form (1NF)

1. Table has a primary key (unique, non-null column that identifies each row)**
2. No repeating groups of columns
3. Each cell contains a single value

![image1](/assets/img/spotify_post_image1.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Clearly there is no unique primary key in the original dataframe and this is perhaps because the original dataframe is a denormalized version and not in a SQLite3 schema (so no concept of primary key in this original dataset). Therefore, we skip requirement 1 at this stage.

![image2](/assets/img/spotify_post_image2.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For requirement 2 and 3, we can see from the [original data description](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md)) and the above example record that there is no repeating groups o columns and each cell contains a single value.

     
<br />

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

1. All columns in each row depend fully on candidate keys
    - Identify candidate Primary Key for each row
    - If there is a composite PK, see if other columns have partial dependencies


To achieve 2NF, we would breake the original dataset into `three sub-datasets`:

```javascript
df_song = df[['track_id', 'track_name', 'track_artist', 'track_popularity', 
              'danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', 'mode', 'speechiness', 
              'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'valence', 'tempo', 
              'duration_ms']]
df_album = df[['track_album_id', 'track_album_name', 'track_album_release_date']]
df_playlist = df[['playlist_id', 'playlist_name', 'playlist_genre', 'playlist_subgenre']]
```

<br />


## Third Normal Form (3NF)

1. No transitive dependencies between non-candidate columns

In order to achieve 3NF, we further split and organize the above three datasets into `6 datafrmes`:

- df_song: **track_id**, track_name, track_artist, track_popularity and the other song characteristics
- df_album: **track_album_id**, track_album_name track_album_release_date
- df_playlist_new: **playlist_id**, playlist_name, playlist_genre
- df_playlist_subgenre: **playlist_genre**, playlist_subgenre
- df_song_album: **track_id** and track_album_id
- df_song_playlist: **track_id** and playlist_id

```javascript
df_song = df_song.drop_duplicates(subset=['track_id'])
df_album = df_album.drop_duplicates(subset=['track_album_id'])
df_playlist = df_playlist.drop_duplicates(subset=['playlist_id'])

df_playlist_new = df_playlist[['playlist_id', 'playlist_name', 'playlist_genre']]
df_playlist_subgenre = df_playlist[['playlist_genre', 'playlist_subgenre']].drop_duplicates(
    subset=['playlist_genre'])
    
df_song_album = df[['track_id', 'track_album_id']].drop_duplicates(subset=['track_id'])
df_song_playlist = df[['track_id', 'playlist_id']].drop_duplicates(subset=['track_id'])
```

<br />


# SQLite3 schema

Now that we have done the normalizetion part, we could directly construct a `SQL database` for the above dataframes:

```javascript
import sqlite3

# Create database
con = sqlite3.connect('spotify.db')

# Create tables in the database
df_song.to_sql(name='song', con=con, index = False)
df_song_album.to_sql(name='song_album', con=con, index = False)
df_album.to_sql(name='album', con=con, index = False)
df_song_playlist.to_sql(name='song_playlist', con=con, index = False)
df_playlist_new.to_sql(name='playlist_new', con=con, index = False)
df_playlist_subgenre.to_sql(name='playlist_subgenre', con=con, index = False)
```

The details of this schema are shown as below, the sql queries used to construct this database could be found in the last column:

![image3](/assets/img/spotify_post_image3.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}


## Example SQL query

Now we would use a SQL query to find the names of all playlists that contain instrumentals:

```javascript
%%sql 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_song, playlist_name
FROM song
INNER JOIN song_playlist
ON song_playlist.track_id = song.track_id
INNER JOIN playlist_new
ON playlist_new.playlist_id = song_playlist.playlist_id
WHERE instrumentalness > 0.5 
GROUP BY playlist_name
ORDER BY num_song DESC
```

Here are 10 example `playlists that contain instrumentals`, ordered by the number of songs in each playlist:

![image4](/assets/img/spotify_post_image4.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The above is just a simple example query and we can certainly use many other queries to explore and take further use of this Spotify database freely via SQL. âœ¨
