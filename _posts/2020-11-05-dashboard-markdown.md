This post is about doing data analysis and visualization for the [2017 Doctorate Recipients Dataset](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data) and constructing a dashboard with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) for results demonstration. Note that dashboard built with `Streamlit` originally can only be accessed locally, but we can use [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/t/platform?c=70130000000NZToAAO&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhZT9BRDmARIsAN2E-J0neOTuMFKjU_5XcTFj0g_50syoK-pGXQ6p9fTLCs9nfrJ6aJiafhYaAtFBEALw_wcB) to built a small app and make this dashboard online and public!

My final dashboard can be accessed via this [link](https://tranquil-shelf-65765.herokuapp.com) and the source codes could be find on my [Streamlit-Dashboard](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/Streamlit-Dashboard) branch at GitHub.

# Data

The [2017 Doctorate Recipients Dataset](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data) is quite a rich dateset and contains a lot of information. My analysis mainly focus on information about recipents and institutions. The tables I used are `Table 1, Table 3, Table 5 and Table 6`.

Firstly I did some pre-processing for the excel data to make them more suitable for plotting and visualization (details included in the [pre-processing notebook](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/Streamlit-Dashboard/blob/main/pre-processing%20for%20tables.ipynb)).

For the first three tables oprations are quite simple, mainly about formatting. As for the last Table, it is kind of a nested shape, so I transformed its structure a little bit.

# Visual

In general the design of my dashboard is quite flexible.

In general there are three main sections/categories: `Recipients Info`, `Institutions Info - Ranking`, `Institutions Info - Disciplinary`, which could be chosen from the scroll-down button in the side bar.

```javascript
session = st.sidebar.selectbox("Category", ["Recipients Info", "Institutions Info - Ranking", "Institutions Info - Disciplinary"])
```

<br />

In the `Recipients Info` category, there are two types of animated graphs for two main variables: `Number of Doctorate Recipents` and `Percentage Change from Previous Year`.

For either plot we can use the slider in the side bar to choose the **year range** we want to look at:

```javascript
st.sidebar.subheader("Recipients Info")
year_range =  st.sidebar.slider('Select a range of years',
    min(df.Year+1), max(df.Year), (1990, 2005))
```

<br />

Now the only thing left is to handle the nested `film` column and doing one more round of **API requesting** to get the film names:

```javascript
oldest_films = [requests.get(y).json() for x in oldest.films for y in x]
```
