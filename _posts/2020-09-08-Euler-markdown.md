This post will talk about some interesting programming problems in the famous [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), which is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. As stated on the website, 'although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems'. In the next few minutes, I'll walk you through some useful algorithms and codes that could solve three typical mathe puzzles in Project Euler elegantly.

**You can check the `Euler Project` folder in my `Github Repo` [ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts) for detailed scorce codes and solutions.**

## [Euler Problem 8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)

1. Google "Jekyll themes": Just go ahead and pick your favourite themes from the official Jekyll gallery websites or some posts advocating their own themes.

2. Fork the GitHub Repo: Usually the themes you picked from internet would have a link directing to its own GitHub repo, go fork it.

3. Change your branch name: Here comes the most important setp! Remember to **change the name of the forked branch** in your GitHub repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`. For example, mine is `ZhiQiu976.github.io`.

4. **Modify it**: Now you have already got your own web page `https://<yourusername>.github.io` (Thanks to GitHub, every user could have a free website!). The only thing left is to modify and customize. What we currently have is a pure copy of another person's website, so you would need to follow the instructions in that GitHub repo, read and understand the codes, then go construct your unique website :P

Actually step 4 could be very time-consuming if you want to make your website fancy and well-organized, but it's always good to take use of the open-source codes and develop upon these. I guess that's why we all love communities like Github and that's how we develop our technical skills. Last but not least, do remember to respect the copyright. As you could see at the footer of my website, my website is modified from [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com). I have changed the theme color and reorganized a little bit. If you like my particular design, you can clike on the Github signs above and simply star/fork [my repo](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/ZhiQiu976.github.io).

You may also check its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), there is another detailed tutorial about how to construct a Jekyll website in a standard way (by using ruby gems, full tutorials could be find at [Jekyll's official website](https://jekyllrb.com/resources/)). That way is cerntainly much better than this simplified version of website construction since it is more stable and adjustable. Since my main goal of website construction is for short blog writing and projects summarising, and I want to keep this website as concise as possible, the modification way suits quite well for me at the current stage. Thus, always choose the most appropriate method according to your own need. Hope this post could also make certain contribution to our community by helping some entry-level learners who are in the same situation as me :)
