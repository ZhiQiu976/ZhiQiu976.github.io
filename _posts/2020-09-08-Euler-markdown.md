This post will talk about some interesting programming problems in the famous [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), which is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. As stated on the website, 'although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems'. In the next few minutes, I'll walk you through some useful algorithms and codes that could solve three typical mathe puzzles in Project Euler elegantly.

**You can check the `Euler Project` folder in my `Github Repo` [ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts) for detailed scorce codes and solutions.**
