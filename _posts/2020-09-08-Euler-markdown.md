This post will talk about some interesting programming problems in the famous [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), which is a series of challenging mathematical üßÆ / computer programming ‚å®Ô∏è problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. As stated on the website, 'although **mathematics** will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and **programming** skills will be required to solve most problems'. In the next few minutes, I'll walk you through some useful algorithms and codes that could solve `three typical mathe puzzles` üß© in Project Euler elegantly.

**In the discussion below I would talk about the generalized version of the original problems. The exact answers to the original problems are shown [here](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts/blob/master/Euler%20Project/Euler-problem-output.ipynb).**

**You can check the `Euler Project` folder in my `Github Repo` [ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts](https://github.com/ZhiQiu976/source-codes-tech-posts) for detailed scorce codes and outputs.**

You can simply change the inputs in these .py files and get new outputs by re-running the scripts in your terminal. ‚ú®

## [Euler Problem 8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)

‚ùì Given a 1000-digit number, what are the thirteen adjacent digits in this number that could give the greatest elementwise product? What is the value of this product?

- `Solution`: 
    - The solution logic of this problem is quite transparent: firstly get the collection of all possible **thirteen adjacent digits** in the 1000-digit number. Then calculate the **product** of each 13-digit-set. Lastly find the maximum.
    
    - This logic is quite simple to accomplish in coding. `List comprehension` could be very helpful here.
    
    - Remember to take care of data types.

    '''
    Function for solving Project Euler Problem 8.
    Parameters
    ----------
    s : str
        The original input string of the 1000-digit number, 
        with a line break every 50 digits.
    n : int
        Number of adjacent digits that wants to find greatest product with.
    Returns
    -------
    digits : list of int
        The n adjacent digits in the input 1000-digit number that 
        have the greatest product.
    result : int
        The value of this greatest product.

    # rearrange the original string
    xs = ''.join(s.split())
    # get the adjacent digits
    ss = [list(xs[i : i+n]) for i in range(1000 - (n-1))]
    # turn into floating number
    ss = [list(map(int, s)) for s in ss]
    # calculate productes
    products = [np.prod(s) for s in ss]
    # find the maximum
    idx = np.argmax(products)
    
    result = products[idx]
    digits = ss[idx]
    
    return digits, result

## [Euler Problem 31](https://projecteuler.net/problem=31)

‚ùì Given a set of different denominations of coins, and a target amount of money, how many different ways can this amount of money be made using any number of coins?

- `Solution`:
    - This problem can be done itertively but this method is computationally complex.
    
    - We would use the idea of `dynamic programming` to improve programming efficiency.
    
    - The main idea is: 
        - Firstly we try only using the first denomination to achieve the amount of **[1, 2, ... , total]** and record the **number of ways**,
        
        - then add another denomination, we record the **number of ways** of using only these two denominations to achieve **[1, 2, ... , total]**,
        
            - ![Crepe](/assets/img/Screenshot-1.png)
            
            - The idea behind the above equation is that if you already have **n** ways to achieve amount **j**, the after including a new denomination **i**, you have exactly **n** ways to achieve amount **j + i**.
            
        - next repeat this process until all the denominations get included, and the very last cell would be our answer.
        
    - Note that the order of including different denominations doesn't matter here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : list of int
        The original input value set.
    total : int
        The target total sum.
    Returns
    -------
    total_ways : int
        The number of combinations of the inputs that 
        could sum up to the target total.
        
    '''
    
    # At the beginning of each loop iteration,
    # ways[j] is the number of combinations of using the coin values before i

    # the list is updated within each loop
    # then get the final total number of ways to sum up to the target total
    # in the ways[total] cell

## [Euler Problem 77](https://projecteuler.net/problem=77)

‚ùì What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over a certain number (call it **threshold**) of different ways?

- `Solution`:
    - This problem is an upgraded version of `Problem 31`, so we can use exactly the **same** `dynamic programming` structure/function to compute the **total number of ways** of achieving a sum with a **list of different numbers**.
    
    - Using `next`, `filter` and `itertools` to find this **list of different numbers**.
